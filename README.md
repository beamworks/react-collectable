# react-collectable

Promise-based form validation logic for React.

Approach:

- based on Promises
- declarative, JSX-oriented
- some assembly effort required
- composition using [function-as-child](https://medium.com/merrickchristensen/function-as-child-components-5f3920a9ace9) technique

Brief feature outline:

- asynchronous validation support
- pluggable, minimal and flexible

## To Do

- brief example
- sort out ES6 compilation
- test on Babel
